# Access Road Tracing Client

## How to Start

To run the client side application:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This will start the development server. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Project Overview

This client-side project provides a web interface for visualizing and interacting with 3D point cloud data. The main functionality includes rendering point clouds, selecting points, and tracing optimal access roads or paths on terrain data.

## Potree Integration

This project integrates [Potree](https://github.com/potree/potree), an open-source WebGL based point cloud renderer for large datasets. Potree is used to efficiently visualize and interact with 3D point cloud data directly in the browser.
